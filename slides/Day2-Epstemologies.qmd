# Pull out a piece of paper, and write three things you know to be true.

---

## Turn to your neighbor and discuss:

- **What does it mean** that you know this to be true? What counts as knowing?
- **How/through what means** do you know this to be true? 
- What are the **limits** of your knowledge on this?

## Epistemology

- Greek words
  - Episteme": knowledge; understanding
  - "Logos": reason; argument
- Philosophical study of the nature and limits of knowledge
  - What conditions must be met for us to say that we "know" something to be true?
  - How do a group of people come to acquire knowledge?
  
---

## What counts as knowledge?

- Historically knowledge defined as "justified true belief"
- Does knowledge exist independently of a knowing mind?

  - **Positivists** claim yes, there is objective truth independent of a knower
  - **Interpretivists** and **constructivists** claim no, truths are subjective or tied to a knowing mind
  
---

## How do we acquire knowledge?

- **Empiricists** claim that knowledge emerges from direct observation
- **Rationalists** claim that knowledge emerges from logic and reason

- ...and then there’s testimony, memory, intuition, feeling

---

## Feminist Epistemologies

- All knowledge is **embodied**
  - Contrast with disembodied knowledge - i.e. not tied to a specific body
- Bodies are situated in certain social positions and have a finite point of view (Haraway 1991)
  - Critique of the "unmarked body," the "God trick," or the "view from nowhere"
- Knowledge is tied to particular standpoints 
  - Our experiences, what we’ve read, our education, our social positions, and what our bodies enable us to do, see, hear, taste, touch, and smell
  - Factors are innumerable and unique to every person
