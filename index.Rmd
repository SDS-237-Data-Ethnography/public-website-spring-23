Without rich documentation, quantitative data can strip away critical context needed to interpret values responsibly. This course introduces students to the theory and practice of data ethnography, demonstrating how qualitative data collection and analysis can be brought to bear on the study of data settings and artifacts. Through experiential exercises, students will learn techniques in field-note writing, participant observation, in-depth interviewing, documentary analysis, and archival research and how they may be used to contextualize the cultural underpinnings of datasets. Students will learn how to visualize datasets in ways that foreground their socio-political provenance in R. Students will also learn how ethnographic methods can be leveraged to improve data documentation and communication. The course will introduce debates regarding the politics of techno-scientific fieldwork. Upon completion of this course, you should be able to:

1. Recognize, interpret, and communicate the cultural underpinnings of data resources, infrastructures, and practices
2. Define and engage principal methods of ethnography and communicate when and how they may be used in the study of data
3. Strategically apply relevant ethnographic methods to the study of a data setting or artifact
4. Produce data documentation and visualizations that account for the cultural contexts of data production, categorization, measurement, and use

Classes will be held on Mondays and Wednesdays from 9:25 PM to 10:40 PM.

I am a cultural anthropologist that studies how civic data gets produced, how communities think about and interface with data, and how data infrastructure can be designed more equitably. My Ph.D. is in an interdisciplinary discipline called Science and Technology Studies - a field that studies the intricate ways science, technology, culture, and politics all co-constitute each other. I work on a number of collaborative research projects that leverage public data to deepen understanding of social and environmental inequities in the US, while also qualitatively studying the politics behind data gaps and inconsistencies. As an instructor, I prioritize active learning and often structure courses as flipped classrooms. You can expect in-class time to predominantly involve group activities and live problem-solving exercises.

## Pedagogical Partner

Rose Evard (she/her) is a ’23 Biology and Statistics & Data Science double major who took SDS 237 last semester.  She’s passionate about bringing data science principles and strategies into her biology research.  She has been involved in various forms of student support, including working as a Data Assistant and SDS Tutor last semester.  Rose can provide technical guidance for GitHub and R, as well as advice on how to approach the course and assignments.

## Course Texts

This semester we will be reading Crystal Biruk's [**Cooking Data: Culture and Politics in an African Research World**](https://www.dukeupress.edu/cooking-data). The book should be available at the Smith bookstore. I will make all other course readings available on Perusall, which can be accessed through our course Moodle page. 

## Assessment

This course will be graded via a [grading contract](grading_contract.html).
