Classroom discussions and activities will provide you with an opportunity to work through complex concepts and apply and reflect on what you've learned in course readings in collaboration with your colleagues. Attending class is not only supporting your own success in this course, but is also an act of community. I will not be formally taking attendance in this course, but certain criteria for your final grade can only be demonstrated through regular attendance in classroom discussions, so I expect students to be present when possible. Missing more than three classes involving final project group work can impact your grade by a letter grade. Up until your fourth absence, you do not need to tell me when you plan to be absent from class. Upon your fourth absence, please reach out to me via Slack. If you are sick, please stay home.
