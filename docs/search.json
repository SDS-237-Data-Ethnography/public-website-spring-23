    "text": "Course logo designed by Zoe Scheffler, Fall ’21\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout rich documentation, quantitative data can strip away critical context needed to interpret values responsibly. This course introduces students to the theory and practice of data ethnography, demonstrating how qualitative data collection and analysis can be brought to bear on the study of data settings and artifacts. Through experiential exercises, students will learn techniques in field-note writing, participant observation, in-depth interviewing, documentary analysis, and archival research and how they may be used to contextualize the cultural underpinnings of datasets. Students will learn how to visualize datasets in ways that foreground their socio-political provenance in R. Students will also learn how ethnographic methods can be leveraged to improve data documentation and communication. The course will introduce debates regarding the politics of techno-scientific fieldwork. Upon completion of this course, you should be able to:\n\nRecognize, interpret, and communicate the cultural underpinnings of data resources, infrastructures, and practices\nDefine and engage principal methods of ethnography and communicate when and how they may be used in the study of data\nStrategically apply relevant ethnographic methods to the study of a data setting or artifact\nProduce data documentation and visualizations that account for the cultural contexts of data production, categorization, measurement, and use\n\nClasses will be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9:25 PM to 10:40 PM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLindsay Poirier, she/her/hers.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am a cultural anthropologist that studies how civic data gets produced, how communities think about and interface with data, and how data infrastructure can be designed more equitably. My Ph.D. is in an interdisciplinary discipline called Science and Technology Studies - a field that studies the intricate ways science, technology, culture, and politics all co-constitute each other. I work on a number of collaborative research projects that leverage public data to deepen understanding of social and environmental inequities in the US, while also qualitatively studying the politics behind data gaps and inconsistencies. As an instructor, I prioritize active learning and often structure courses as flipped classrooms. You can expect in-class time to predominantly involve group activities and live problem-solving exercises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRose Evard, she/her\n\n\n\n\n\nRose Evard (she/her) is a ’23 Biology and Statistics & Data Science double major who took SDS 237 last fall. She’s passionate about bringing data science principles and strategies into her biology research. This is her second semester as a Pedagogical Partner for SDS 237. Rose will participate in class discussions, provide guidance for approaching assignments, and is available for technical assistance.\n\n\n\nSlackMeeting with Me\n\n\nI can best support students in this course when I can readily keep tabs on our course-related communication. Because of this, I ask that you please don’t email me regarding course-related questions or issues. The best way to get in touch with me is via our course Slack. If you have course-related questions, I encourage you to ask them in the #sds-237-questions channel. When discretion is needed, feel free to DM. Please reserve more formal concerns like grades or accommodation requests for an in-person (or in-person virtual) conversation.\nDuring the week, I will try my best to answer all Slack messages within 24 hours of receiving them. Please note that to maintain my own work-life balance, I often don’t answer Slack messages late in the evenings or on the weekends. It’s important that you plan when you start your assignments accordingly.\n\n\nMeeting with me outside of class is a great opportunity for us to chat about what you’re learning in the course, clarify expectations on assignments, and review work in progress. I also love when students drop in to office hours to request book recommendations, discuss career or research paths, or just to say hi!\nThere are two ways to meet with me. If you would like to have a one-on-one private conversation, I ask that you schedule an appointment with me via the booking form on Moodle. For support on class topics, you may drop-in during my regularly scheduled office hours.\n\nMonday, 11-12, Sabin-Reed 331\nTuesday, 11-12, Sabin-Reed 331\nThursday, 11-12, Sabin-Reed 331\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis semester we will be reading Crystal Biruk’s Cooking Data: Culture and Politics in an African Research World. The book should be available at the Smith bookstore. I will make all other course readings available on Perusall, which can be accessed through our course Moodle page.\n\n\n\nThis course will be graded via a grading contract.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJacobson Center\n\n\n\nSmith’s Jacobson Center asserts that all students can improve their communication and learning skills. I encourage all students to take advantage of their writing support services, workshops, and tutors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparationAttendanceExtensionsAcademic HonestyParticipationReadings\n\n\nThis is a 4-credit course with 3 hours per week of in-classroom instructions. Smith expects students to devote 9 out-of-class hours per week to 4-credit classes. I have designed the course assignments and selected the course readings with this target in mind.\n\n\nAttending class is not only important for your learning but also an act of community. Attendance is expected in this course. Many course assignments will be completed in-class. That said, you do not need to inform me when you will be absent. If you are sick, please stay home. If you must miss a class entirely, you should contact a peer to discuss what was missed. Please note that the SDS Program has adopted a shared policy regarding in-person attendance this semester:\n\nIn keeping with Smith’s core identity and mission as an in-person, residential college, SDS affirms College policy (as per the Provost and Dean of the College) that students will attend class in person. SDS courses will not provide options for remote attendance. Students who have been determined to require a remote attendance accommodation by the Office of Disability Services will be the only exceptions to this policy. As with any other kind of ADA accommodations, please notify your instructor during the first week of classes to discuss how we can meet your accommodations.\n\n\n\nI understand that you will sometimes need to prioritize other things over meeting assignment deadlines (e.g. your health, wellness, families, communities, jobs, other coursework). However, there are a number of reasons that I find enforcing deadlines to be supportive of student learning in this course:\n\nFirst, one of the key aims of assignments in this course is to support you in learning to become more perceptive to data environments surrounding you. Because of this I’ve deliberately spread course assignments out over the semester in order to help you gain practice in consistently paying attention to these environments. This critical mode of thinking can’t be cultivated effectively if the work is being crammed into later parts of the semester.\nSecond, because this course emphasizes student growth over achievement, I also want to ensure that I can provide feedback on your writing in time for you to incorporate it into future assignments.\n\nThere is a 24-hour grace period on all written assignments. There will be no penalties for submitting the written assignment within this 24-hour period, and you do not need to inform me that you intend to take the extra time. You can also request up to a 72-hour extension on any written assignment, as long as you make that request at least 48 hours before the original assignment due date. You can request an extension by filling out the Extension Request form on Moodle, and I will confirm your extension on Slack. Beyond this, late assignments will not be accepted.\nNote that this policy does not apply to reading assignments/Perusall annotations. Reading assignments/Perusall annotations need to be completed by the due date for credit.\n\n\n\nSmith College expects all students to be honest and committed to the principles of academic and intellectual integrity in their preparation and submission of course work and examinations. Students and faculty at Smith are part of an academic community defined by its commitment to scholarship, which depends on scrupulous and attentive acknowledgement of all sources of information, and honest and respectful use of college resources. Any cases of dishonesty or plagiarism will be reported to the Academic Honor Board. Examples of dishonesty or plagiarism include:\n\n\nSubmitting work completed by another student as your own.\nCopying and pasting words from sources without quoting and citing the author.\nParaphrasing material from another source without citing the author.\nFailing to cite your sources correctly.\nFalsifying or misrepresenting information in submitted work.\nPaying another student or service to complete assignments for you.\nSubmitting work generated by artificially intelligent tools such as chatGPT\n\n\n\nActive participation in this course is generally expected and encouraged. That said, we all have off-days - be it from illness, sadness, heartbreak, or exhaustion. I too will have off-days where my words just don’t seem to cohere, or my brain will feel jumbled. Because of this, I’ve provided a number of ways to demonstrate engagement throughout the semester.\n\n\nI have put a lot of thought into the assigned readings for this course - aiming to select pieces that are relevant, engaging, challenging, accessible, and represent a diverse set of voices. Our classroom discussions will be much richer, more meaningful, and fun when all students come to class having completed and annotated assigned course readings. While I know that reading may seem like a low priority when you have impending assignments that you need to physically hand-in, I encourage you not to wait until the last minute to complete course readings. You will get the most out of the content if you give yourself time to digest and reflect on it.\nIf you are struggling to keep up with the readings, please reach out to me. I’m more than happy to talk through effective reading strategies and to provide more guidance on what I’d like you to get out of a specific piece.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode of ConductPrinciples of CommunityPronouns\n\n\nAs the instructor for this course, I am committed to making participation in this course a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion. Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants in this course include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.\nAs the instructor I have the right and responsibility to point out and stop behavior that is not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Participants who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be reprimanded for such behavior. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the instructor.\nAll students and the instructor are expected to adhere to this Code of Conduct in all settings for this course: seminars, office hours, and over Slack.\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.0.0, available here.\n\n\nI hope that we can foster a collaborative and caring environment in this classroom: one that celebrates successes, respects individual strengths and weaknesses, demonstrates compassion for each other’s struggles, and affirms diverse identities. Here are some ideas that I have for creating this environment in our course:\n\nCheck-in with colleagues before starting collaborative work. “What three words describe how you’re feeling?” “Name one challenge and one success from this week.” “What are you doing for self-care right now?” Thank each other for sharing where they’re at.\nConsider when to step up and when to step back in class discussions, creating space for others to contribute. Listening is just as important to community-building as speaking.\nAcknowledge that there is much we don’t know about how our colleagues experience the world. …but don’t ask colleagues to speak on behalf of a social group you perceive them to be a part of.\nCheer on colleagues as they give presentations or try something out for the first time.\nAsk questions often in our #sds-237-questions channel. Help each other out by answering questions when you can.\nMistakes happen. I will certainly make mistakes in class. Admit mistakes, and then move on.\n\n\n\nUsing the proper pronouns for our students is foundational to a safe, respectful classroom environment that creates a culture of trust. For information on pronouns and usage, please see the Office of Equity and Inclusion link here: Pronouns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccommodationsStudent Well-beingTrigger Warnings\n\n\nIt is my goal for everyone to succeed in this course. If you have personal circumstances that may impact your experience of our classroom, I encourage you to contact Office of Disability Services in College Hall 104 or at ods@smith.edu. The Office will generate a letter that indicates to me what kind of support you need and how I can make your classroom experience more accommodating. Once you have this letter, you are welcome to visit my office hours or email me to discuss ideas about how we can tailor the course accordingly. While you can request accommodations at any time, the sooner we start this conversation, the better. If you have concerns about the course that are not addressed through ODS, please contact me. At no point will I ask you to divulge details about your personal circumstances to me.\n\n\nCollege life is stressful, and life outside of college can be overwhelming. It is my position that attending to your physical and mental health and well-being should be a top priority. I will remind you of this often throughout the semester. I encourage you to schedule a time to talk with me if you are struggling with this course. If you, or anyone you know, is experiencing distress, there are numerous campus resources that can provide support via the Schacht Center. I can point you to these resources at any time throughout the semester.\n\n\nA trigger is a topic or image that can precipitate an intense emotional response. When common triggering topics are to be covered in this course, I will do my best to provide a trigger warning in advance of the discussion. However, I can’t always anticipate triggers. With this in mind I’ve set up an anonymous form, available on Moodle, where you can indicate topics for which you would like me to provide a warning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoodlePerusallSlackGitHub\n\n\nGrades, forms, and handouts will be available on the course Moodle.\n\n\nAll course readings and recorded lectures will be available on Perusall. You can access Perusall via our course Moodle page.\n\n\n\n#general: Course announcements (only I can post)\n#sds-237-discussions: Share news articles and relevant opportunities\n#sds-237-questions: Ask and answer questions about our course\nYou can also create private Slack channels with your project group members.\n\n\n\nI will be using GitHub Classroom to distribute several course assignments, and you will submit assignments by pushing changes to template documents to a private GitHub repository. I will provide guidance on how to do this early in the semester.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio/RStudio Server\n\n\n\nThis class will use the R statistical software package. In the first week of the course, I will help you install and configure R and RStudio. If you are using a laptop, you will install both on that computer. If you are using a Chromebook or Tablet, an account will be created for you on the Smith College RStudio Server so that you can access a cloud-based version of RStudio. You should let me know in the first week of the course if you are using a Chromebook or tablet."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This course will be using a grading contract. This means that the grade you ultimately receive for this course is primarily based on the labor that you perform rather than a subjective evaluation of the quality of your work and writing in relation to your colleagues. Your grade will be determined by the extent of your engagement in class, your timely completion of assignments, and how you support the course community. You will still attend to and work to improve the quality of your writing and thinking in this course. You will receive extensive feedback on all of your submissions (from me and from your colleagues), and you will have opportunities to revise. However, you will not receive points or an A, B, C, D, etc. on assignments.\nI’ve experimented with a few alternative grading systems, and I’m particularly excited to continue engaging this system this semester as I believe it aligns with my overarching goals for the course. In this course I am less concerned with your ability to come to a specific answer, to master certain procedures, or to produce standardized deliverables. I’m more concerned with the extent to which this course enables you become more perceptive to data environments, to deepen your critical thinking about data’s cultural meanings, to experiment with your thinking and writing, and to grapple with ethical dilemmas. There’s always room for strengthening these thinking modes further; in fact, every time I teach this course, I find that my own ability to think critically about data deepens through classroom discussions and my reading of student work.\nThere are many benefits to contract grading. Here are there reasons why I’ve opted for a grading contract in this course:"

For an assignment to be considered complete, it must meet the minimum criteria outlined in the assignment description. It also must be completed “in good faith” - meaning in a way that demonstrates integrity to the spirit of the assignment.\nBelow I’ve outlined completion criteria for the two non-written assignments for this course.\n\nReading Annotations\nEach week a selection of course readings will be posted as a single assignment on Perusall - a system for students to collaboratively annotate course readings. To earn this credit, you will be expected to post 3 quality annotations per assignment to Perusall. (Note that a single assignment can have multiple readings, but you need only submit 3 annotations total. You do not need to annotate every reading in the assignment.) A quality annotation is one in which you synthesize concepts, ask thought-provoking questions, or connect ideas to external issues. I have found that students get the most out of Perusall when they respond to each other’s annotations. Annotations must be completed before class to receive credit.\n\n\nCommunity Labor\nEthnography is at its best when it involves collaborative inquiry and interpretation. Because of this, I want to encourage us to foster a cooperative community in our classroom. Ethnographers know that building and sustaining strong communities are important and often invisible forms of labor. In an effort to foreground and reward that labor, I’ve built opportunities to contribute to the course community into our grading contract. There are three opportunities for earning community labor points in this course. It will be your responsibility to keep track of your community labor via our course labor log (see FAQ).\n\nContributing on Slack\nThe first opportunity for earning community labor points is through posting in the #sds-237-discussions Slack channel. For every conversation that you initiate in this channel, you will earn 1 community labor point. For every conversation that you respond to in this channel with substantive summary, critique, or reflection, you will earn 1 community labor point. Finally, for every question that you answer in the #sds-237-questions channel, you will earn 1 community labor point.\n\n\nCompleting Group Evaluations\nMid-way through the semester you will have an opportunity to evaluate your own contributions to your group work, along with that of your peers. Your feedback will be shared with members of your group. Completing group evaluations will count for 1 community labor point.\n\n\nParticipating in Peer Review Workshops\nThroughout the semester, I will set up workshops where students may submit their written work for peer review in preparation for assignment submissions. Each peer review workshop that you participate in will count for 2 community labor points.\n\n\nContributing Class Notes\nFollowing a class period, up to two students may type up a 1-page outline of what was covered in that class period and post a link to that outline in #sds-237-class-notes. You can sign-up to serve as the notetaker for a certain class here. These notes should be a full, single-space page, and should make sense to someone that was not present in class. Each class note outline that you contribute will count for 2 community labor points.\nNote that throughout the semester, I may offer additional opportunities to earn community labor points as unexpected forms of course labor arise.\n\nThe final project will be completed in groups, and considerable chunks of the group project will be completed in class on Thursdays. While I will not formally be taking attendance for this course, I reserve the right to adjust your final grade by a letter grade if you’ve missed more than three classes involving final project group work. Be sure to reach out to me early on if there are extenuating circumstances that will consistently impact your attendance."

    "title": "Grading Contract",
    "section": "FAQ",
    "text": "FAQ\n\nWhat do I need to do to earn an A in this course?\n‘A’ grades will be assigned to students that meet the requirements to earn a ‘B’ in the course and enrich those assignments by completing three additional reflective assignments. Prompts for these assignments will be included in the GitHub repository for your learning portfolio. The deadline for completion of enrichment assignments is the last day class meets. It will be the students’ responsibility to stay on top of completion of these assignments. Furthermore, enrichment assignments completed prior to the last two weeks of class will receive more substantive feedback from me than assignments completed in the last two weeks.\n\n\nWhat kind of feedback will I receive regarding my work?\nYou will receive extensive feedback on all of your submissions (from me and from your colleagues), and you will have opportunities to revise. I will also provide rubrics for most assignments to indicate how I will evaluate your work. However, you will not receive points or an A, B, C, D, etc. on individual assignments.\n\n\nThere appear to be a significant number of assignments and deadlines in this course. Why is this the case?\nI’ve been very deliberate in pacing your assignments for two reasons - first, because developing the critical thinking skills required of ethnography demands building and consistently practicing observational habits, and second, to ensure there is plenty of time for you to revise work based on my feedback. If you are struggling with this course’s workload, I recommend coming to talk with me in office hours.\n\n\nHow can I best keep track of my labor in this course?\nThroughout the semester, you will be asked to keep track of your labor via a log that will be available in your GitHub portfolio. I will reference this log to calculate certain aspects of your final grade. Instructions for using the labor log will be provided in the second week of the course.\n\n\nCan I earn +/- grades in this course?\n+/- will be assigned to final grades at my discretion in cases where a student’s work consistently exceeds the expectations (+) of their contracted grade or is in some way insufficient (-). Students can track their progress towards a grade modifier in feedback that I provide throughout the semester.\n\n\nWhat if I need an extension on an assignment?\nThere is a 24-hour grace period on all written assignments, except for reading annotations. There will be no penalties for submitting the written assignment within this 24-hour period, and you do not need to inform me that you intend to take the extra time. You can also request up to a 72-hour extension on any written assignment, as long as you make that request at least 48 hours before the original assignment due date. You can request an extension by filling out the Extension Request form on Moodle, and I will confirm your extension on Slack. Beyond this, late assignments will not be accepted.\n\n\nCan I ask for extensions or use the grade period for reading annotations?\nReading assignments/Perusall annotations prepare you to participate in class discussions. For this reason, they need to be completed by the due date for credit. I’ve provided considerable leeway to miss a reading annotation assignment from time-to-time in order to accommodate flexibility in this regard.\n\n\nAn assignment deadline is approaching, and I’m unhappy with the quality of my work. What should I do?\nWhile I always encourage students to strive to submit the best work they can, this course’s grading contract, coupled with the course’s revision assignments, permits you to submit work that you know you want to continue to improve upon without penalty. Not submitting assignments at all has the potentially to significantly lower your grade in this course, whereas submitting an assignment that could benefit from more revision will not be detrminental to your grade as long as the minimum submission requirements are met."
