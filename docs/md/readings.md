I have put a lot of thought into the assigned readings for this course - aiming to select pieces that are relevant, engaging, challenging, accessible, and represent a diverse set of voices. Our classroom discussions will be much richer, more meaningful, and fun when all students come to class having completed and annotated assigned course readings. While I know that reading may seem like a low priority when you have impending assignments that you need to physically hand-in, I encourage you not to wait until the last minute to complete course readings. You will get the most out of the content if you give yourself time to digest and reflect on it. 

If you are struggling to keep up with the readings, please reach out to me. I'm more than happy to talk through effective reading strategies and to provide more guidance on what I'd like you to get out of a specific piece.
