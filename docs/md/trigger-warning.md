A trigger is a topic or image that can precipitate an intense emotional response. When common triggering topics are to be covered in this course, I will do my best to provide a trigger warning in advance of the discussion. However, I can't always anticipate triggers. With this in mind I've set up an anonymous form, available on Moodle, where you can indicate topics for which you would like me to provide a warning.
