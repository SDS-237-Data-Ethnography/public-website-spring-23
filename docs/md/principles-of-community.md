I hope that we can foster a collaborative and caring environment in this classroom: one that celebrates successes, respects individual strengths and weaknesses, demonstrates compassion for each other's struggles, and affirms diverse identities. Here are some ideas that I have for creating this environment in our course:

* If a classmate helps you out on an assignment, says something brilliant that solidifies the material for you, or just listens when you've had a bad day, give them a shout-out on our `#sds-237-appreciation` Slack channel. 
* Check-in with colleagues before starting collaborative work. "What three words describe how you're feeling?" "Name one challenge and one success from this week." "What are you doing for self-care right now?" Thank each other for sharing where they're at.
* Consider when to step up and when to step back in class discussions, creating space for others to contribute. Listening is just as important to community-building as speaking. 
* Acknowledge that there is much we don't know about how our colleagues experience the world. ...but don't ask colleagues to speak on behalf of a social group you perceive them to be a part of. 
* Cheer on colleagues as they give presentations or try something out for the first time.
* Ask questions often in our `#sds-237-questions` channel. Help each other out by answering questions when you can. 
* Mistakes happen. I will certainly make mistakes in class. Admit mistakes, and then move on.
